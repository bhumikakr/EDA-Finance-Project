# EDA-Finance_Project

- In this data project the focus is on exploratory data analysis of stock prices. Keep in mind, this project is just meant to practice my visualization and pandas skills, it is not meant to be a robust financial analysis or be taken as financial advice.

- Data analysis performed over bank stocks to see how they progressed throughout the financial crisis all the way to early 2016.

- You'll need to install pandas-datareader for this to work! Pandas datareader allows you to read stock information directly from the internet
  
  
  ```
    Install pandas_datareader: pip install pandas-datareader
    ```
